4. Test Cases
4.1 Login Functionality
Scenario: User Login
Given the user is on the Twitter login page
When the user enters valid credentials

Then the user should be redirected to the home page
And the user's profile information should be visible
Scenario: Invalid Credentials
Given the user is on the Twitter login page
When the user enters invalid credentials
And clicks on the login button
Then an appropriate error message should be displayed
4.2 Tweet Functionality
Scenario: Compose a Tweet
Given the user is logged into Twitter
When the user clicks on the compose tweet button
And enters the tweet message
And clicks on the tweet button
Then the tweet should be posted successfully
And the tweet should be visible on the user's profile
4.3 Search Functionality
Scenario: Search for Users
Given the user is logged into Twitter
When the user enters a search query for another user
And clicks on the search button
Then relevant user profiles should be displayed
4.4 Profile Functionality
Scenario: Edit Profile Information
Given the user is logged into Twitter
When the user navigates to the profile settings
And edits the profile information
And saves the changes
Then the profile information should be updated successfully
4.5 Follow/Unfollow Functionality
Scenario: Follow User
Given the user is logged into Twitter
When the user navigates to another user's profile
And clicks on the follow button
Then the user should be following the other user
And the follower count of the other user should increase by 1
5. Conclusion
